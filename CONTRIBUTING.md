# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to CHAKANOKs Supply Chain Management System.

Quick guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create feature branches from `main` (or your working branch).
- Keep changes small and focused; prefer many small PRs over one large one.
- Follow PSR-12 coding style for PHP files and keep existing project conventions.
- Write or update tests for new features or bug fixes where applicable.
- Run `composer install` and ensure the app boots locally before submitting a PR.

Reporting issues:

- Use GitHub issues to report bugs or request features, include steps to reproduce.

Thanks — maintainers will review and provide feedback.
